# ProiectMDS

# Online Shop 
The online shop would be built using ASP.NET, which is a web development framework that allows developers to build dynamic web applications and websites. The online shop would include a user-friendly interface for customers to browse products, add items to their shopping cart and check out securely. Customers would be able to create an account, view their order history, track their orders and communicate with customers. The application would also include a powerful back-end system for managing products, orders, and customers.
